## Note
Purpose of this Organisation Repository to maintain and develop for future my Final Year College Project. This project uses IoT and Machine Learning with Web, Mobile and Desktop Application. So, I had to keep it in a separate space for more maintaining and future collaboration.

This project is now a hobby project. Where I am extending all it's feature and will try to deploy at no cost.
